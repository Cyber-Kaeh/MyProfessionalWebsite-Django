#### The Workhorse

**Asus Vivobook 16**

This is the laptop I bought when I went back to school in 2023. I paid $700 for it
new, and it's nothing extravagant, but this bad boy has been through its paces.
This is the laptop I learned to code on and has put up with me constantly installing
and removing tons of programs.

#### The Underdog

**Dell Optiplex 7020 (Circa 2013?)**

This thing would have been insane brand new when it first came out; I lovingly slapped
it together for a fraction of what it would have been back then.
- Intel i7
- 32 GB Ram
- Asus GTX 1050Ti OC 4GB
- 500 GB SSD / 500 GB HD

I put Fedora Workstation on it, and it outperforms my laptop in most tasks. My IDEs love
it, especially Android Studio. Gnome Boxes is blazing fast for prototyping or just
messing around with VMs, but the most interesting is how it handles local AI.
It handles Llama3.1 without breaking a sweat, up to 7b anyway... the bigger ones were
painful to try.

#### Delicious!

**Raspberry Pi 4**

What's better than a freshly baked pie? Well, plenty of things in my opinion, but more
specifically, a freshly baked Pi with Ubuntu Server and Docker serving up all my little
projects around the clock with almost no power draw or noise and fits handsomely on
the corner of an end table in my living room! I have learned so much about Docker, 
networking, web servers, proxies, running Python/Flask apps... and on and on I can't
possibly count all the different things I've learned from playing with this little guy.

#### The Relic

**Dell XPS L702X**

This is another baddie from the past, but it hasn't aged quite as well as the Optiplex.
I did manage to breathe some life into it with a new SSD and maxed out the RAM (16GB).
Running Windows Server 2022, and SQL Server on it works great now for simple tasks, but I
haven't gotten to really see what it can do with any kind of big analytics workloads. So
far I've only used it for simple remote queries from Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
and lightweight ETL pipelines with Python, mostly just for testing purposes to ensure it
works while I'm still learning more about ETL.
