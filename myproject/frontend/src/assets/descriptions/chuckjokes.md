#### Updates!

This has been a really fun project for me and a great opportunity to practice
iterating over something fun and silly. This little guy is now hosted on an
AWS EC2 instance and is publicly available, unless my free tier runs out or I 
tear it down for something else. I have also added some more quotes to it and 
implemented Bootstrap5 for a little better visual appeal. I have left the original picture in place as a reference, feel free to check it out:
